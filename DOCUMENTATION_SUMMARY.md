# Documentation Summary

This document provides a quick overview of the comprehensive MCP documentation added to this repository.

## What Was Added

A complete set of documentation explaining how the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is used in the LSP-MCP-Bridge extension.

## Quick Answer to "How is MCP being used?"

**Yes, MCP is contributing 10 tools to GitHub Copilot!**

The extension uses VS Code's Language Model API (which implements MCP concepts) to register 10 LSP tools that GitHub Copilot automatically discovers and uses:

1. `lsp_definition` - Find symbol definitions
2. `lsp_references` - Find symbol references
3. `lsp_hover` - Get symbol information
4. `lsp_completion` - Get completions
5. `lsp_workspace_symbols` - Search workspace symbols
6. `lsp_document_symbols` - Get document structure
7. `lsp_rename_symbol` - Preview renames
8. `lsp_code_actions` - Get quick fixes
9. `lsp_format_document` - Preview formatting
10. `lsp_signature_help` - Get function signatures

## Key Insights

1. **MCP Integration**: Uses VS Code's Language Model API (MCP-based)
2. **Tool Contribution**: Yes, 10 tools actively contributed
3. **Bridge Concept**: Translates MCP ↔ LSP protocols
4. **Works WITH clangd**: Doesn't replace language servers, makes them AI-accessible
5. **Universal Support**: Works with any LSP-compliant language server

## Architecture at a Glance

```
GitHub Copilot
    ↓ (Language Model API - MCP-based)
LSP-MCP-Bridge Extension
    ↓ (VS Code executeCommand APIs)
VS Code LSP Infrastructure
    ↓ (Language Server Protocol)
Language Servers (clangd, Pylance, etc.)
```

## Value Proposition

Without this extension:
- Copilot guesses based on code snippets

With this extension:
- Copilot uses actual language server intelligence
- Accurate definitions, references, type information
- Works across any programming language with a language server

## Build Status

✅ All builds pass  
✅ Linting passes  
✅ Code review clean  
✅ Security scan (CodeQL) - No issues (documentation only)
